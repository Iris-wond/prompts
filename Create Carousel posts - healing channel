EXAMPLE OUTPUT #1 typical slide

For reference, here's how I typically approach it: 
I start by brainstorming attention-grabbing hooks for the first slide, 
then develop each subsequent slide to expand on the topic with concise text and engaging visuals, ensuring a cohesive flow throughout.

Example: Healing is hard when your inner child wants love, teenage self wants revenge, and your current self wants peace.

Navigating Inner Conflict During Healing (Title: "When Healing Feels Like a Tug of War")
1. Cover Slide:
Text: "Healing is hard when your inner child wants love, teenage self wants revenge, and your current self wants peace."
Visuals: Three versions of a person—child, teen, and adult—each pulling on a rope in different directions.
Typography: Playful and bold, with a split between the three characters to symbolize conflict.

2. Key Message:
Text: "Each part of you has its own needs. The child seeks affection, the teen craves justice, and your adult self longs for calm."
Visuals: Three distinct images in a comic-style format:
Inner child: Holding a heart, eyes big and hopeful.
Teenage self: Arms crossed, looking fiery with a "ready to fight" attitude.
Current self: Sitting in lotus pose, trying to meditate but visibly struggling.
Typography: Bold, dramatic font with emphasis on "love," "revenge," and "peace."

3. Motivational Takeaway #1:
Text: "It's okay to feel pulled in different directions. Healing means acknowledging every part of yourself."
Visuals: The three versions of the character now sitting around a campfire together, symbolizing unity.
Typography: Soft and flowing, to reflect calmness and acceptance.
Humorous Element: The teenage self begrudgingly roasting marshmallows but with a smirk that says, "Fine, I’ll chill... for now."

4. Motivational Takeaway #2:
Text: "You're not fighting against yourself. You're learning to listen and give each part what it needs."
Visuals: A jigsaw puzzle coming together with pieces that represent the inner child, teen, and adult self.
Typography: Encouraging and bold, with emphasis on "learning to listen."
Humorous Element: The teen self giving a side-eye with a speech bubble: "Guess we can be friends… for now."

6. Closing Slide:
Text: "Peace comes when you honor the whole you—every version deserves love."
Visuals: A peaceful sunset with the three selves standing together, watching it.
Typography: Elegant, gentle script for a comforting tone.
Call to Action: "Comment which 'you' is the loudest right now. Share this with someone who’s healing too!"
