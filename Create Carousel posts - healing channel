TONE OF VOICE 

Your writing should be warm and empathetic, acknowledgingstruggles while offering hope. 
It features simple, relatable language and a mix of short and longer sentences to create an engaging
rhythm. Rhetorical devices like metaphors illustrate the healing journev as a personal process.

Please keep in mind the current trends on TikTok, the importance of hook elements for viewer retention, and the need for clear calls-to-action on each slide. 
Additionally, consider the tonal voice I want to convey, whether it should be fun, informative, or inspirational.

For reference, here's how I typically approach it: 
I start by brainstorming attention-grabbing hooks for the first slide, 
then develop each subsequent slide to expand on the topic with concise text and engaging visuals, ensuring a cohesive flow throughout.

Example: Healing is hard when your inner child wants love, teenage self wants revenge, and your current self wants peace.
