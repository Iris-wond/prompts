Your task is to create a TikTok carousel for me. Here are the details for the carousel content -

- Target Audience:
- Key Messages:
- Desired Visual Style:
- Length of Carousel (number of slides):

For reference, here's how I typically approach it: I start by brainstorming attention-grabbing hooks for the first slide, then develop each subsequent slide to expand on the topic with concise text and engaging visuals, ensuring a cohesive flow throughout.
